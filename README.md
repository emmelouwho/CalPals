# Deviations:
We have not been able to implement the sign-in through Google and Apple, but it will hopefully be included in the Beta submission.

We will be fine tuning scheduling at a later time since scrolling isn't seemless at the moment. The Table View with times does not scroll together with the Collection View but that will be fixed in the Beta sumbmission. Additionally, the days that go on top of the Collection View columns are also missing but will be present in the Beta submission.
